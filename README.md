- 👋 Hi, I’m @santi-souza

- 👀 I’m interested in Bioinformatics, Biostatistics computational biology, and the intersection of data science and healthcare.
  I am particularly passionate about applying machine learning techniques to analyze complex biological data and contribute to personalized medicine.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced methods in bioinformatics and biostatistics, with a focus on omics data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling in medical settings. 
  I'm also expanding my knowledge in high-performance computing (HPC) and workflow management systems.

- 💼 My Experience:
  - DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, and Sanger sequencing.
  - Omics data analysis, including RNA-Seq, proteomics, and microarrays.
  - Proficient in R, Python, SQL, and bioinformatics tools like FASTQC, HISAT2, and GATK.
  - Currently finalizing my MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects that involve bioinformatics, data analysis, and the development of reproducible research pipelines. 
  I am eager to contribute to multidisciplinary teams working on cutting-edge research in genomics, transcriptomics, and precision medicine.
