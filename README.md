👋 Hi, I’m Santiago Souza Nava (@santi-souza)

👀 What I'm interested in:
I specialize in the intersection of Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology, with a focus on machine learning applications to biological data. I’m especially enthusiastic about using AI and machine learning to analyze complex omics data and predict disease outcomes in healthcare.

🌱 Education:
- MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics | CEMP
Thesis: "Stroke: Statistical Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Machine Learning Prediction"
This project focused on applying statistical methods and machine learning models (including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting) to predict stroke based on complex datasets.

- BSc in Biotechnology Engineering | ORT University
Thesis: "Molecular Detection of Lethal White Overo Syndrome and Congenital Stationary Night Blindness in Horses"
I utilized Sanger sequencing and capillary electrophoresis to identify genetic mutations in horses, contributing to disease diagnostics in veterinary medicine.

💼 Experience:
Bioinformatics and Biostatistics:
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on healthcare datasets (stroke prediction).
- Built predictive models using machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting).
- Knowledge in analyzing Omics data (RNA-Seq, WGS) for biological insights.
- Proficient in genomic analysis tools like FASTQC, HISAT2, GATK, and DESeq2.

Programming Skills:
- Bash/Unix
- R (Data Analysis, Statistics, Machine Learning)
- Python (Bioinformatics, Data Science, Machine Learning)
- SQL (Data Management, Querying)
- Familiar with bioinformatics pipelines and tools for high-throughput sequencing analysis.

🧬 Looking for:
I’m eager to collaborate on bioinformatics and data analysis projects, particularly those focused on genomics, precision medicine, and AI-powered healthcare solutions. I am looking to contribute to multidisciplinary teams and help develop reproducible research pipelines for cutting-edge biological research.
