Hi, I’m Santiago!

**🌱 Education:**
- MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics | CEMP
  - Thesis: "Stroke: Statistical Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Machine Learning Prediction"
  - This project focused on applying statistical methods and machine learning models (including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting) to predict stroke based on complex datasets.

- Biotechnology Engineering | ORT University
  - Thesis: "Molecular Detection of Lethal White Overo Syndrome and Congenital Stationary Night Blindness in Horses"
  - I utilized Sanger sequencing and capillary electrophoresis to identify genetic mutations in horses, contributing to disease diagnostics in veterinary medicine.

**💼 Experience:**
Bioinformatics and Biostatistics:
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on healthcare datasets (stroke prediction).
- Built predictive models using machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting).
- Knowledge in analyzing Omics data (RNA-Seq, WGS) for biological insights.
- Genomic analysis tools like FASTQC, HISAT2, GATK, and DESeq2.
- Bash/Unix, R (Data Analysis, Statistics, Machine Learning), Python (Bioinformatics, Data Science, Machine Learning), SQL (Data Management, Querying)
